# Rouge Access Point
## Version 0.1
A robust toolkit for setting up malicious wireless access points and using them to preform a variety of attacks aimed at client devices. The core components of the rouge AP, the AP host, DHCP server, and the DNS server, exist seperately from each other and the program's main script as their own programs, being ran and coordinated by the main script as system daemons while also retaining the ability to be used by themselves since they are self contained and not depended on the rest of the project to be ran and preform their respective service. This allows them to be updated, reloaded, started, and stopped without impacting other areas of the rouge AP, and minimizes damage when failures occur. The AP host utilizes hostapd under the hood to handle 802.11 broadcasting and client device authentication, and both the DHCP and DNS server are custom Python implementations built specifically to help facilitate client attacks and traffic modification/redirection, as well as device tracking and data harvesting. This program is currently under development, so be warned!
